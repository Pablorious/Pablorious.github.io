	    <p>&emsp; Hi! I am Pablo Reboredo-Segovia. I am a lover of music, art, comedy, computers, mathematics, and philosophy. I like working with both physical and digital instruments and media to depict and observe the world around me.</p>
	<p>&emsp; I am a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and I'm making a living tutoring and providing consultancy work to undergraduates, graduates, and doctoral struggling with equations encompassing statistics, biology, ecology, econometrics, etc. I have gained a strong foundation in multivariable calculus, abstract algebra, matrix algebra, real analysis, probability and statistics, numerical algorithms, and models in biology. 
	<p>&emsp;I want to create a better interface between people and technology to overcome the limitations doing things with only our own minds, and enhance the existence of the human being. Ultimately, I want a more hopeful and sustainable future and a better environment for learners around the world </p>

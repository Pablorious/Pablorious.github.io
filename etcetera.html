			<h2>Message to Future Students</h2>
			<small>What I've learned</small>
			<p> &emsp; Hey, while some of the assignments may seem like busywork, they were all designed to make us more competitive in the job market nad better prepared for future careers</p>
			<p> &emsp; Through the course of the class, we learned to develop a polished resume, hone our networking skills, make a linkedin page (which is suprisingly important), and practice interviewing techniques.</p>
			<p> &emsp; Doing this stuff made a big difference for me because to be honest I wouldn't be practicing or doing this stuff in school outside the context of a class. Being here helped me hunker down and focus on getting this done making the transition to a career after college much easier.</p>
			<p> &emsp; One thing that has stuck with me and I'd like to share with you is that career readiness doesn't have to mean sacrificing your individuality for the sake of a corporation. Instead, we were encouraged to identify our goals and values and find a career path that aligned with them. You don't have to become Allen Bateman to have a nice life, and your work and what you want to experience in life can have quite a bit of overlap</p>

			<h2>Intercultural Development Plan</h2>
			<p> Select three different social identity groups: culture, race, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability and religion. </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Culture: Any </li>
				<li>Race: Any </li>
				<li>Disability: Blindness, Deafness</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Describe three steps that you have taken to demonstrate openness, inclusiveness, sensitivity, and respectful interaction with each of the groups in the past.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>&emsp; I've accepted that I don't know anything about anyone really. I think the best conversational style is to share what I'm interested in and leave it up to the conversation parter what they want to share. Any question is really a kind of assumption since there's a limit to how open-ened it could be</li>
				<li>&emsp; With respect to the needs of people with blindness or vision impairments I'm making an effort to make my website navigable using tts technology -- I won't be adding any images without a description alternative or a written description beneith</li>
				<li>&emsp;For those with issues hearing I'm keeping this site free of audio-only sources of information and any videos I add will have captions</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Write three meaningful action steps that you plan to take to develop your competency for each of your selected groups</p>
			<ol>
				<li>&emsp; I have taken courses on linkedin over inclusive website design and will continue to maintain informed about inclusive design practices in the future through the MDN network</li>
				<li>&emsp; I know with respect to culture in race that there is no standing still on a moving train. Special effort must be taken to observe the achievements of, and include in the proces of technology development those who come from a variety of backgrounds. This will constribute to an alleviation of the symptoms of world history, albeit I think it is far from a cure.</li>
				<li>&emsp;With respect to disability, many times the obstacles to those with vision or hearing impairment are caused by the lack of consideration in the design of our infrastructure. I think it's a lot like how it's like to play minecraft without Elytra -- a lot of content made by ones friends in not accessible because having wings is a given and so things like stairs are an afterthought. I've been trying out phone and website navigation using screen reading technology and have already seen some areas that could use work on websites such as spotify -- I won't be making the same mistakes</li>
